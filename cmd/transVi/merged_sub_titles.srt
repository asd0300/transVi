1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Thank you very much, everybody, well, very, very much.

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:23,920
Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,320
The Golden Age of America begins right now.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,960
We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,280
of any longer.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,120
During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Our sovereignty will be reclaimed, our safety will be restored, the scales of justice will

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,640
be rebalanced, the vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
and our government will end.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,160
In our top priority, we need to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,480
America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,080
I return to the presidency confident.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
it, an optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,840
A tide of change in sweeping trees, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,760
has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,000
But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,280
While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,960
witnessing in the United States of America.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
America.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,240
As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,900
For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,440
extracted power and wealth from our citizens.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,040
The pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,040
incomplete disrepair.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,880
We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,680
crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,680
continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,280
but provide sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,560
many from prisons and mental institutions,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,400
that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,840
We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders,

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,040
but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly,

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,000
its own people. Our country can no longer-

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
to deliver basic services in times of emergency,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,540
as recently shown by the wonderful people

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,740
of North Carolina, been treated so badly.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,940
And other states who are still suffering

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,140
from a hurricane that took place many months ago,

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,020
or more recently, Los Angeles,

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,580
where we are watching fires still tragically burn.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,580
From weeks ago, without even a token.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,640
wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,400
right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. But we can't let this happen.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,240
Everyone is unable to do anything about it that's going to change. We have a public health system

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,840
that does not deliver in times of disaster. Yet more money is spent.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
on it than any country anywhere in the world.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,280
And we have an education system that teaches our

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,780
children to be ashamed of themselves, in many

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,280
cases, to hate our country despite the love that

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,320
we try so desperately to provide to them.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,120
All of this will change starting today, and it

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,560
will change very quickly.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:29,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:17,280
all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith,

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,200
their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,200
This moment on America's deadline is over.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, and we will immediately

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,360
restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's government.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,800
Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,960
our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
along the way.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,240
The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,540
an easy that I can tell you.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,640
Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,620
my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,820
Just a few months ago in a beautiful Pennsylvania field

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,560
and a Sassan's bullet ripped through my ear.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,620
But I felt then and believe even more so now

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,020
that my life was saved.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
for a reason.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,600
I was saved by God to make America great again.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Thank you very much.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,620
That is why each day, under our administration of American patriots, we will be able to meet

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,000
every crisis with dignity and power and strength.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,160
We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,960
citizens of every race, religion, color, and creation.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
for American citizens January 20th, 2025 is Liberation Day.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:22,500
It is much that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,480
and most consequential election in the history of our country.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
As our victory showed, the entire nation is wrapped.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,440
increases in support from virtually every element

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,440
of our society, young and old men and women,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,520
African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,720
urban, suburban, rural.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,120
And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,120
seven swing states.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,760
And the popular vote, we won by millions of people.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
To the black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,080
outporn of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,880
and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices and the campaign and I look

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,360
forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,240
and his honor, this is a great honor, but in his honor we will strive.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:29,160
National unity is now returning to

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
America. And confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,880
administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,760
We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,760
forget our God. Can't do that.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,840
With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,080
of common sense.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,280
So all about common sense.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,280
I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process.

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,000
All illegal entry will be halted, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process, and we will begin the process

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
of returning millions and millions of criminal

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,520
aliens back to the places from which they came.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,820
We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:21,200
I will end the practice of catch and release.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,200
And I will send troops to the southern border

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,000
to repel the disastrous.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
invasion of our country.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Under the orders I signed today, we will also be

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,080
And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,840
and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,920
foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,840
our cities and inner cities.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
As Commander-in-Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,960
from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,160
We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,480
Next I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,000
to do what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,440
overspending and escalating energy prices. And that is why

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,480
today I will also declare a national energy emergency.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,480
We will drill baby drill.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,220
America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,160
manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth,

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
and we are going to use it.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:16,600
American energy all over the world.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,160
We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,340
help to do it.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,940
With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the election.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:20,240
great American auto workers.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,080
In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,960
We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
have dreamt possible just a few years ago.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,140
And thank you to the other workers of our nation

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,880
for your inspiring vote of confidence.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,540
We did tremendously with it.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:18,580
I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,280
to protect American workers and families.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,160
Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,600
we will tariff and tax foreign countries.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
to enrich our citizens.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:14,140
For this purpose, we are establishing the external revenue

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,040
service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues that will be

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,340
massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury, coming from

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,000
foreign sources.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The American dream will soon be back and thriving like now.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
ever before, to restore competence and effective

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,140
governance to our federal government.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,440
My administration will establish the brand new

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Department of Government Efficiency.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:28,260
After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,260
federal efforts to restrict

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
free expression.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,520
I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,120
back free speech to America.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:30,000
Never again will the immense power of the state

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
be weaponized to persecute political opponents.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Something I know something about.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We will not allow that to happen.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It will not happen again.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
under the constitutional rule of law.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:22,280
and gender into every aspect of public and private life.

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,080
We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,500
there are only two genders, male and female.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
This week, I will reinstate any service members who can justly expelled from our military

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:24,240
for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pain.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,700
I will sign in order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
and social experiments while on duty.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
It's going to end immediately.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:13,600
Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,500
defeating America's enemies.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Applause

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,080
In 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,920
We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,840
My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
unifier.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,360
That's what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm pleased to say that as of yet.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,440
back home to their families.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Thank you.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,780
most powerful, most respected nation on Earth,

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,080
inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,380
A short time from now, we are going to be changing the

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,180
name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,320
and we will restore the name of a great President,

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
William McKinley, to Mount McKinley,

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
where it should be.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
at where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,720
through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,640
of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,960
to the country of Panama after the

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
The United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,180
than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,580
lives in the building of the Panama Canal.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,680
We have been treated very badly from this

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,180
foolish gift that should have never been made.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,160
And Panama's promise to us has been broken.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,040
has been totally violated, American ships.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
ships are being severe, overcharged, and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,080
And that includes the United States Navy.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,360
And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it a China.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,640
We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,660
Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,960
with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:27,520
So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,120
We will not be deterred.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,040
Together we will end.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,160
The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,300
our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,480
our flag into new and beautiful horizons.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,320
And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,320
to plant the stars in the stars and the stars in the stars and the stars in the stars.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
and stripes on the planet Mars.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:30,060
Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation and right now our nation is more ambitious.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
than any other—there's no nation like our nation.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,500
Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,980
The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:22,380
The call of the next great adventure, downs from within our souls.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,820
Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,000
into a mighty repose—

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
public of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,980
No one comes close.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:13,040
Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,560
They crossed desert-scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West ended slavery,

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,160
rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
the atom, launched mankind into the heavens.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
and put the universe of human knowledge

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,600
into the palm of the human hand.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,500
If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,940
and no dream we cannot achieve.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,180
Many people thought it was impossible for me

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,380
to stage such a historic political comeback.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,220
But as you see today, here I am.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,120
The American people have spoken.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,300
Thank you.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,560
Cheers and applause.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,280
I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,280
to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston,

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,520
to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,400
patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,600
They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners,

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,000
police officers and pioneers.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,500
to their spirit or their pride.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,140
Together, they laid down the railroads,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,780
raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways,

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,380
won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism,

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,460
and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,420
After all, we have been through together.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
We stand on the verge of the four greatest years.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
years in American history.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,540
With your help, we will restore our American promise,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,700
and we will rebuild the nation that we've been.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,940
We love it so much.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,240
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,740
under God.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,280
So, to every parent who dreams for their child,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,220
and every child who dreams for their future,

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,020
I am with you, I will fight for you,

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,320
and I will win for you.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,720
We are going to win like never before.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:24,640
In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,720
and make it great again, greater than ever before.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
We will be

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
nation like no other full of compassion courage and exceptionalism, our power will stop all wars

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,920
and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,600
America will be rescinded again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith,

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,120
and goodwill. We will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,120
never before.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Or we will not be conquered.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,360
We will not be intimidated.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,920
We will not be broken.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,520
And we will not fail.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,760
From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,640
We will stand bravely.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,880
We will live proudly.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,520
We will boldly and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,960
The future is ours and our golden age has just begun.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Thank you, God bless America.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,060
Thank you all.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Thank you.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,060
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,060
Thank you very much.
